I live on the river, at the river bank.
I had a boat on the river. I was on the river every day. The river is great.
A storm pulled the boat from the river bank. The boat sank in the river, far from the bank.
I needed money for a bank loan to get a new boat. I went to the bank. The bank was open.
I told the bank that I need a new boat. The bank told me they would loan me the money.
I called the bank every month about the money for the loan. I need the money. I need the loan.
I miss my boat. I live on the river bank but don't have a boat.
It took a year for the bank to loan me the money for the boat. The bank said I would get the money for the boat
I bought a new boat with the money from the bank.
Now I take the boat out on the river. I added a pier to the river bank for the boat.
